# the following generates a random sequence of destinations/origins
example <- sample(c("ngaoundere", "likok","martap"), size=nrow(file), replace=T)
file <- cbind(file, example) # include the new var in the df
#
# now need to assign each obs to a specific label (location) according to a %
# (e.g. 10 to A, 50 to B, 40 to C) but also to repeat this assignment evry month on the df
# otherwise it would not respect the real monthly flow of animals but only a static picture of the year
#
# In my total blankness I thought that maybe a sort of "probability apprach" could be used to do that?
# in which we could define the probability of the obs to come from or going to according to the 
# information we have from the questionnaires? do you think could be a good approach?
# 
# I've seen sample() has a prob argument but doesn't seem to work for this purpose
#
# or better writing a fx that actually assings a label for every animal through this approach?
